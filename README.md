# amber-trade-spread-gate

`amber-trade-spread-gate` explores trading systems in Zig. The repository keeps the core rule set compact, then surrounds it with examples that show how the decisions move.

## Amber Trade Spread Gate Notes

The quickest review path is the verifier first, then the fixtures, then the operations note. That order makes it easy to see whether the code, data, and explanation still agree.

## Feature Notes

- Includes extended examples for fills, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents portfolio pressure tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## Why This Exists

I use this kind of project to make a rule visible before adding more machinery around it. The important part here is not the size of the codebase. It is that the input signals, scoring rule, fixture data, and expected output can all be checked in one sitting.

## Code Tour

- `src`: primary implementation
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Implementation Notes

The core is a scoring model over demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight. That keeps order state, risk checks, and fills in one explicit decision path. The threshold is 166, with risk penalty 4, latency penalty 2, and weight bonus 5. The Zig version uses compile-time constants and native test blocks for fast local checks.

## Try It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Example Scenarios

The examples are meant to be readable before they are exhaustive. They cover enough variation to show how latency and risk can pull a decision below the threshold.

## Tests

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Boundaries

The examples cover useful edges, not every edge. A larger version would add malformed-input tests, richer reports, and deeper domain parsers.

## Roadmap

- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add one more trading systems fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Local Setup

Use a normal shell with Zig available on `PATH`. The verifier is written as a PowerShell script because the portfolio was assembled on Windows.
